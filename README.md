# Blobby's Escape

This was my final project at SPICED Academy. A 2D-Platformer game made with Phaser. It's about the prince of blob-kingdom, "Blobby", who wants to escape his evil father, who was so hungry that he ate his wife, Blobby mother, for dinner. Which is basically unforgivable.



My challenges were to learn a new framwork for JavaScript without anyone showing me "the right way". And also I love games, so it was an obvious choice to check out what I could do with JavaScript when it comes to games. 



All graphics and animations are handmade by myself. Feel free to use any of them if you like - just mention me please :-)



#### Live Website

The Game will be going live in the coming days. So hold your horses just a bit longer :-)



## Built With

- [Phaser](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/) - JavaScript framwork to create HTML5 games.
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/). - for creating the server
- [Tiled Mapeditor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) - to create the level
- [pyxel edit](https://pyxeledit.com/) - to create the graphics and animations used in the game

## Project Overview

#### <u>Start Screen</u>

Once the game loaded up you will see the start screen with a little animation where Blobby is chased by a Jumpsquare.

Once you hit the start button, a little cut-scene will play, that gives you a bit of story and setup of why Blobby wants to escape his father and the Blob Kingdom.

#### <u>Level</u>

After the cut scene the actual level will begin. On the top of the screen you can see your points, which deplete the longer you need to finish the level. You move with the arrow keys or "W,A,S,D"-keys. You can also shoot tiny blob balls to get rid of your enemies from a distance. And as soon as you found the gravity crystal, you can hover in thin air for a short period of time 



Here is a little taste of the actual level design:

There are 3 types of enemies: 

* JumpSquares: square shaped soldiers who your father sent after you to get you back. They will always try to catch you - but they are not the smartest, so they will even fall down into the abyss just to get to where you are... Use that for your advantage or just jump on their heads to get rid of them.
* The Rolling Stones: annoying balls of rock that just cant stop going forward. they will be stopped by nothing, so dont even try - better just dodge them and try to avoid them! 
* The King: your father, the King of the Blobs.  He is waiting for you at the Great Waterfall, the only known way out of Blob Kingdom, to stop you with all he has got. He will shoot his disgusting Blob-Balls at you and cause Earthquakes by angrily jumping up and down, which will cause the cave to rumble and stones to fall from the ceiling. So you better be prepared to do what it takes to get out of there. Dont hesitate to shoot, the King won't, either! 



Now go on and try it yourself. (As soon as the game actually is uploaded ;)) Hope you enjoy it!
