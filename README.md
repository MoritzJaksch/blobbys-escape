# Blobby's Escape

This was my final project at SPICED Academy. A 2D-Platformer game made with Phaser. It's about the prince of blob-kingdom, "Blobby", who wants to escape his evil father, who was so hungry that he ate his wife, Blobby mother, for dinner. Which is basically unforgivable.



My challenges were to learn a new framwork for JavaScript without anyone showing me "the right way". And also I love games, so it was an obvious choice to check out what I could do with JavaScript when it comes to games. 



All graphics and animations are handmade by myself. Feel free to use any of them if you like - just mention me please :-)



#### Live Website

The Game will be going live in the coming days. So hold your horses just a bit longer :-)



## Built With

- [Phaser](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/) - JavaScript framwork to create HTML5 games.
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/). - for creating the server
- [Tiled Mapeditor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) - to create the level
- [pyxel edit](https://pyxeledit.com/) - to create the graphics and animations used in the game

## Project Overview

#### <u>Start Screen</u>

Once the game loaded up you will see the start screen with a little animation where Blobby is chased by a Jumpsquare. Once you hit the start button, a little cut-scene will play, that gives you a bit of story and setup of why Blobby wants to escape his father and the Blob Kingdom.

#### <u>Signature</u>

After signing up and giving a bit of additional information like age and hometown, you will be forwarded to the signature page. Here you can use the mouse cursor to draw you signature and submit it for the good cause.

#### <u>Personal Drawing</u>

Because you supported the cause, you will be able to make little drawing of your own, to show off to all the other signers. This is a little Canvas Mod i built myself, which allows you to choose different colours and pen sizes to draw whatever you like.

#### <u>Signers Page</u>

When you are happy with your drawing and submit it, you will get to a page, where you can see all the signers and their works of art. So be sure to check those out!

#### Change your Info

By using the navbar on the bottom of the page you can always go back and change your signature, your drawing and your user information if you made a mistake or just want to draw something new.
